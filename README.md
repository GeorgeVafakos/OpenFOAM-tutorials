OpenFOAM tutorials for educational purposes using `OpenFOAM v2406`. The following cases are included:

## airfoil 

Incompressible, steady-state 2D flow past an airfoil. The computational domain C-grid is created using a python script, obtained by [curiosityFluids](https://curiosityfluids.com/). The data for the geometry of the airfoil are downloaded from the [airfoiltools](http://airfoiltools.com/) online database. The Spalart–Allmaras model is used to calculate the turbulence.
